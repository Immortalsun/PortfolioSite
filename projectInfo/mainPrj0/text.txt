Motor Control (Arduino C++)
The main function of this code is to take analog input from a potentiometer, attempt to reduce signal noise, and translate the output to a PWM signal required to run a DC electric motor. Here I have chosen to use an exponential smoothing function. Potentiometer input is received (byte input 0 to 255) and based on the previous reading (we generate an initial reading if there isn't one), a forecast for the next input reading is generated.These values are averaged to produce a value that will increase or decrease the motor speed without jumps/hiccups in the signal.
